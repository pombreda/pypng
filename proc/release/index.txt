Release Procedure

Not even a draft, just some notes.

Edit setup.py for new version number.  Then "svn commit" this.

Get the latest svn change number:
svn st -u | tail -1
(this is called CHANGE below)

at top-level...

Update our sources to the particular revision.
svn up -r CHANGE

Buld the documentation:
python build.py

Make source distribution using Python distutils
python setup.py sdist -f

The -f option is essential, it prevents sdist from copying the wrong set
of files.  Without -f sdist will examine the MANIFEST file which may be
out of date.

Make a record in release/index.txt

Upload dist/pypng-X.Y.X.tar.gz to google code.
