Release Procedure
=================

Extremely draft.

At top-level...

Edit ``setup.py`` for new version number.  Then ``svn commit`` this.

Get release notes into ``README.txt`` somehow.

Get the latest svn change number::

  svn st -u | tail -1

(this is called *CHANGE* below)

Update our sources to the particular revision::

  svn up -r CHANGE

Buld the documentation::

  python build.py

Make source distribution using Python distutils::

  python setup.py sdist -f

The ``-f`` option is essential, it prevents ``sdist`` from copying the wrong
set of files.  Without ``-f`` ``sdist`` will examine the ``MANIFEST`` file
which may be out of date.

It's possible at this point that you might want to smoke-test the actual
release binary.  Let's assume that the release binary is good to go.

Make a record in ``release/index.txt``

Upload ``dist/pypng-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`` to google code.

Upload to PyPI:

  python setup.py sdist upload

(You can register releases on PyPI without uploading them:
"python setup.py register")
